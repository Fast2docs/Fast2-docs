An MDO file is a flat file defined such as: each line corresponds to a document and each line contains information about the document
The extraction of information from each line is based on a CSV configuration file, which provides the name of the metadata to be inserted into the punnet document, as well as its characteristics.


It consists of the following columns, separated by a comma:

- Field: name of the metadata to add \n
- Length: length of the metadata. If the value is greater than this length, then it will be truncated. If the value is lower, it will be completed by spaces on the right \n
- Offset: position in MDO file \n
- Mandatory: Y / N \n
- Occurs: number of occurrences allowed for the field. The successive values ??of the field will then be added to the values ??of the metadata (respecting the Length parameter for each one) \n
- Type: Type of metadata to add to the punnet document \n


The MDOParserExternalContent task is used to retrieve external content for each document. To do this, the name of the column defining the content path is specified in the task settings.
