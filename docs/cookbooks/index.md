!!! hint

    A cookbook in the programming context is collection of tiny programs that each demonstrate a particular programming concept. The Cookbook Method is the process of learning a programming language by building up a repository of small programs that implement specific programming concepts.

Here are some examples of short use-cases with Fast2, covering APIs management which might be required for configuring some of the tasks.

This section will particularly be insightful for custom module development.

You will find here boilerplate code snippets, as well as real-life examples of task configuration for challenges you might take up, one day.
